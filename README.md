# RUTM -  RAM UP THE MOON

EOS CPU rental price increased 30 times after EOS CPU mining!

EOS ram is too cheap and should be more valuable!

At present, the EOS RAM pool has 4.46 million EOS(72G RAM), including B1 3.3 million (now shrunk to 2.34 million) 32G, 10.3G (750,000) has been used, B1 + 10.3G has been used = 3.1 million EOS, there are only 1.36 million EOS in the pool, most of holder are wallets and project owners, and hardcore holders such as wangruixiwww, have no speculation. The 10th holder is only 30,000 EOS.

RUTM token is live on EOS chain through EOS RAM mining.

80 million of the 100 million RUTM tokens will be airdropped for free, until all tokens are airdropped.

Flow the ram in your account. Maximize the value of RAM.

Let us use EOS RAM to mining, and let EOS RAM up moon.

### Contract address

The token contract will be based on EOS address **ramupthemoon** 

block explorer address: https://bloks.io/account/ramupthemoon   
github address: https://github.com/baromjon/ramupthemoon

## Airdrop rule 1
### Send the start EOS ram mining seed

Start block time:   2019-11-30T12:00:00.000 

Step: 
your EOS account sends 0.0001 EOS to contract mining address ramupthemoon with memo seed, it will immediately send 0.0001 RUTM and 0.0001 EOS tokens to you,  The process is as follows:
```
EOS account → 0.0001 EOS(memo: seed) → ramupthemoon;
```
```
ramupthemoon → 0.0001 RUTM and 0.0001 EOS → EOS account;
```

The total number of seeds：1000 seeds.

After 1,000 EOS RAM mining seeds have been released, then announce the EOS RAM mining rules and mining time .


## Airdrop rule 2
### EOS RAM mining

Start block time:   2019-12-01T12:00:00.000 

EOS account sends 0.0001 RUTM to the EOS ram mining contract address ramupthemoon. It will immediately send 1.0001 RUTM tokens to you. Once one time mining is completed, a new RUTM token will be generated for each mining. 0.25 RUTM will be sent to the contract publishing account. At the same time, the transfer EOS account will occupy 1KB ram, which can be recycled. The process is as follows:
```
EOS account → 0.0001 RUTM → ramupthemoon;
```
```
ramupthemoon → 1.0001 RUTM → EOS account, 
```
at the same time occupies 1KB ram of EOS account.
You can mining 1-100 RUTM at one time, and you can mine 100 RUTM by transferring 0.01 RUTM at one time. Make sure you have enough memory on your account.

## Rules for EOS ram recycle

EOS account send one RUTM token to the mining contract account ramupthemoon, memo: freeram, EOS account can recycle 1KB EOS RAM occupied by the EOS ram mining, return the occupied 1KB EOS RAM to the EOS account, At the same time, the one transfer RUTM token is destroyed. One RUTM token is equal to the recycle right of 1KB EOS RAM. The process is as follows:
```
EOS account→1 RUTM (memo: freeram)→ramupthemoon
```
The 1KB EOS RAM occupied by the EOS account ram mining is recycled, and 1 RUTM is destroyed. The recycled EOS RAM can be sold.
Sending 100 RUTM at a time can recycle 100KB RAM.


## RUTM model

When mining One RUTM will occupy 1KB EOS RAM for EOS account, and one RUTM recycle will return 1KB EOS RAM for EOS account. At the same time, the RUTM will be destroyed. RUTM is a deflation model, with a total amount of 100 million, one RUTM token equal to the recycle right of 1KB EOS RAM, and the number of RUTM will be continuously reduced due to the destruction of recycled EOS RAM.  

RUTM mining output, EOS RAM miners buy EOS RAM for mining, resulting in EOS RAM price rising, EOS RAM price rising, miners can recycle the EOS RAM occupied by mining stage and sell it for profit, RUTM is the EOS RAM recycle right for EOS mining account, with value basis, and the total amount will continue to decrease,At present, the total amount of EOS RAM is 142.2g, 72g has been sold, one RUTM mining out to occupy 1KB EOS RAM, one thousand RUTM mining out occupy 1m EOS RAM, one million RUTM mining out occupy 1g EOS RAM, and 80 million RUTM mining out occupy 80g EOS RAM. If the RUTM is all mining out and not recycled, most of EOS RAM will be sold out. EOS RAM rushes to the moon.

EOS RAM mining let you feels the charm of price model of EOS RAM.

***Tip: the contract account cannot participate in the activity.***
