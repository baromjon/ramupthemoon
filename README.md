## Airdrop rule 1
### Send the start EOS ram mining seed

Start block time:   2019-11-30T12:00:00.000 

Step: 
your EOS account sends 0.0001 EOS to contract mining address ramupthemoon with memo seed, it will immediately send 0.0001 RUTM and 0.0001 EOS tokens to you,  The process is as follows:
```
EOS account → 0.0001 EOS(memo: seed) → ramupthemoon;
```
```
ramupthemoon → 0.0001 RUTM and 0.0001 EOS → EOS account;
```

The total number of seeds：1000 seeds.

After 1,000 EOS RAM mining seeds have been released, then announce the EOS RAM mining rules and mining time .
